# Machine-Translation
NMT: Use of neural network models to learn a statistical model for machine translation.

Given a sentence T in the target language, we seek the sentence S from which the translator produced T. We know that our chance of error is minimized by choosing that sentence S that is most probable given T. Thus, we wish to choose S so as to maximize Pr(S|T)
